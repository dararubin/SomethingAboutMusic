I drove through the front yard</br>
I parked on the bridge</br>
I saw the coastline like I never did</br>
You know nothing lasts forever</br>
No, nothing lasts forever</br>
</br>
I thought that I blocked out December</br>
Until I heard the news</br>
I swore that I left you inside of the glovebox</br>
Next to the other things I never used</br>
</br>
I drove through the front yard</br>
I parked on the bridge</br>
I saw the coastline like I never did</br>
I thought nothing lasts forever</br>
No, nothing lasts forever
[x2]</br></br>

I thought we'd be in this together</br>
Until I heard the news</br>
And now I'm alone with my thoughts and the ocean</br>
I'll stay here forever waiting for you</br></br>

I drove through the front yard</br>
I parked on the bridge</br>
I saw the coastline like I never did</br>
I thought nothing lasts forever</br>
No, nothing lasts forever
[x2]</br>
</br>
Go!</br>
</br>
I drove through the front yard</br>
I parked on the bridge</br>
I saw the coastline like I never did</br>
I thought nothing lasts forever</br>
No, nothing lasts forever

Well the night gets old so I'm back again. </br>
The day just started because I'm up with my old friends, </br>
the fat smoke and funny joke. </br>
Sitting like a sponge, letting everything soak. </br>
</br>
And I just got the nerve to get in the cage so don't bite me now. </br>
And I just got the nerve to get in the cage so don't bite me now. </br>
</br>
We made love tonight as the result of a fight. </br>
When you put your arms around me the whole worlds alright. </br>
And a days worth of bitching goes down the drain </br>
when you lay in my bed and pick my brain. </br>
Shut up! Shut up! It's my turn to talk.</br>
Don't try and run before you learn to walk. </br>
Because a days worth of bitching goes down the drain </br>
when you lay in my bed and pick my brain.</br>
</br>
I left my heart with my phone in my center console.</br>
I left my feelings with my wallet and my keys</br>
I feel so stupid because I came here without anything</br>
But I'm finally at ease</br>

So why the sudden change</br>
And what's this all about? </br>
I know they speak your name, </br>
But where's the sound right now? </br>
I can't stop praying you'll hear me play. </br>
I know that I'll be with you there someday. </br>
</br>
So where the hell's my hope, </br>
And why can't I just try? </br>
You know I've lost a lot, </br>
But I won't let this die. </br>
I know I've got a friend up in the atmosphere, </br>
And another reason not to fear the sky; </br>
No, not tonight. </br>
</br>
Can I pull out all the stops, </br>
And get out of this town? </br>
I want to make you proud, </br>
But I really don't know how. </br>
I know it's not helping to hear me say, </br>
"I wish it was me in the car that day."</br>
Though something made me stop and think of what you said. </br>
You know it meant a lot, </br>
But I was just a kid, </br>
One with all these dreams of growing up and playing music on the road. </br>
I've been screaming all these years and thinking of you both.</br>
</br>
So where's my hope, </br>
And why can't I just try? </br>
You know I've lost a lot, </br>
But I won't let this die. </br>
I know I've got a friend up in the atmosphere, </br>
And another reason not to fear the sky; </br>
No, not tonight. </br>
</br>
I wrote this note, </br>
Because I never even told you. </br>
You know I've got some things to sing about, </br>
Like we were young and holding true </br>
To all these songs that always made us pull through, </br>
And now I've got some words that I'll write down. </br>
I'm sending this shit out. </br>
</br>
So where's my hope, </br>
And why can't I just try? </br>
You know I've lost a lot, </br>
But I won't let this die. </br>
I know I've got a friend up in the atmosphere, </br>
And another reason not to fear the sky; </br>
No, not tonight. </br>
</br>
So where's my hope, </br>

I need some time just deliver the things that I need for now</br>
Everything that I feel's like a warm deep calm casting over me</br>
And it's taking me to somewhere new</br>
</br>
If you believe that everything's alright</br>
You won't be all alone tonight</br>
And I'd be blessed by the light of your company,</br>
Slowly lifting me to somewhere new</br>
</br>
Oh can you tell, I haven't slept very well</br>
Since the last time that we spoke, you said</br>
"Please understand if I see you again don't even say hello."</br>
</br>
Please</br>
</br>
What a night it is, when you live like this</br>
And you're coming up beneath the clouds,</br>
Don't let me down</br>
All the love's still there I just don't know what to do with it now</br>
You know, I still can't believe we both did some things</br>
I don't even wanna think about</br>
Just say you love me and I'll say "I'm sorry,</br>
I don't want anybody else to feel this way"</br>
No, no, no</br>
</br>
Oh can you tell, I haven't slept very well</br>
Since the last time that we spoke, I said</br>
"Please understand I've been drinking again, and all I do is hope"</br>
</br>
Please... stay</br>
Please stay</br>
</br>
I'll admit I was wrong about everything</br>
Cause I'm high and I don't wanna come down</br>
All the fun that we had on your mothers couch,</br>
I don't even wanna think about</br>
</br>
I'm not strong enough for the both of us</br>
What was I supposed to do</br>
You know I love you</br>
Whoa-oh</br>
</br>
Please just stay</br>
Stay

I'm the setting sun behind the trees, the saddest one you've seen.</br>
I've been burning holes and breaking dreams, and I regret it.</br>
I'm fixing things I've broken, it's not as easy as it used to be.</br>
I'm throwing temper tantrums. I used to settle, but now I make a scene.</br>
</br>
You can't believe...</br>
</br>
I said I'd never walk away, but I'm not able to stay.</br>
I said I'd never leave this place, but I can't stay here.</br>
To watch you fade and watch you change into someone I can't face.</br>
I can't replace, I can't replace you.</br>
</br>
You're the swirling wind above the sea, the maddest storm they've seen.</br>
Now you're breaking waves and smashing dreams, and you can't help it.</br>
You're drowning streets and stranding a million people, you're starting out with me.</br>
You're crashing down from anger, your stuff is settled and now you're sound asleep.</br>
</br>
And so serene...</br>
</br>
I said I'd never walk away, but I'm not able to stay.</br>
I said I'd never leave this place, but I can't stay here.</br>
To watch you fade and watch you change into someone I can't face.</br>
I can't replace, I can't replace you.</br>
</br>
And when the sun is down and when the skies are calm you'll see, calm will be.</br>
We'll wait for the cycle, we'll repeat our same mistakes. Same mistakes we've always made.</br>
</br>
I said I'd never walk away, but I'm not able to stay.</br>
I said I'd never leave this place, but I can't stay here.</br>
To watch you fade and watch you change into someone I can't face.</br>
I can't replace, I can't replace you.</br>
</br>
I said I'd never walk away, but I'm not able to stay.</br>
I said I'd never leave this place, but I can't stay here.</br>

But I'm still hiding underneath</br>
It's been a long time</br>
It's been a long time</br>
A thousand faces looking up at me</br>
Hands all pointed to the ceiling</br>
Oh, what a feeling</br>
</br>
I've got friends in highly low places</br>
I'm standing on post, and I'm posted up</br>
Can't afford to lose them</br>
I've got friends in highly low places</br>
I'll go inside when I wanna party</br>
Grab a girl and dance</br>
(Don't touch me)</br>

Whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh</br>
Why do I put myself in these situations?</br>
Whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh</br>

Girl, who taught you how to move like that?</br>
At this pace you're at you're going way too fast</br>
I, I saw you from across the room</br>
It's me versus every guy</br>
It's your choice</br>
You choose</br>

I've got friends in highly low places</br>
It's been a long time</br>

</br>
You're worth losing my self-esteem</br>
Your clever words mean nothing more to me</br>
Than a lot I've heard in a movie</br>
You're worth losing my, losing my</br>
Losing my self-esteem</br>
You're not worth</br>
Putting myself in these situations</br>

Say a prayer but let the good times roll</br>
In case God doesn't show</br>
(Let the good times roll, let the good times roll)</br>
And I want these words to make things right</br>
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life</br>
"Who does he think he is?"</br>
If that's the worst you got</br>
Better put your fingers back to the keys</br>

One night and one more time</br>
Thanks for the memories</br>
Even though they weren't so great</br>

One night, yeah, and one more time</br>
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories</br>
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter."</br>

Been looking forward to the future</br>
But my eyesight is going bad</br>

They say I only think in the form of crunching numbers</br>
In hotel rooms collecting page six lovers</br>
Get me out of my mind and get you out of those clothes</br>
I'm a liner away from getting you into the mood, whoa</br>

One night and one more time</br>
Thanks for the memories</br>
Even though they weren't so great</br>

Give up and go home, alone, and suffer some more.</br>
This head of stone let's no one in anymore.</br>
My effort is never enough.</br>
I'll start unpacking all of my stuff, cause I've come to know my place,</br>
So let's wreck everything I've built except the base.</br>
</br>
You have no idea how unproductive it is to fall in and out of you as often as I do.</br>
And lately I've been feeling grey but today,</br>
I'm alright no thanks to you.</br>
</br>
Think I'll go and roam outside your boundary.</br>
Walk on the ridge, far away from the city.</br>
Friends of friends prove untrustworthy.</br>
Be gone, just like you were at the last party.</br>
No S.O.S. until the bottles are empty.</br>
</br>
Now my hunger isn't wasted anymore,</br>
Cause I'm younger but I'm tired and I'm sore.
[x3]</br>
I know where you've been, you're ruining men.</br>
Never again will I let someone in.

I am all you've ever wanted,</br>

Sorry I told. I just needed you to know.</br>
I think in decimals and dollars.</br>
I am the cause to all your problems,</br>
Shelter from cold. we are never alone.</br>
Coordinate brain and mouth.</br>
Then ask me whats it like to have</br>
Myself so figured out.</br>
I wish I knew..</br>

I hope this song starts a craze.</br>
The kind of song that ignites the airwaves.</br>
The kind of song that makes people glad</br>
To be where they are,</br>
With whomever they're there with.</br>
This is war.</br>
Every line is about,</br>
Who I don't wanna write about anymore.</br>
Hope you come down with something</br>
They can't diagnose, don't have the cure for.</br>
Holding on to your grudge.</br>
Oh its so hard to have someone to love.</br>
And keeping quiet is hard.</br>
Cause you cant keep a secret</br>
If it never was a secret to start.</br>
At least pretend you didn't wanna get caught..</br>
</br>
We're concentrating on falling apart.</br>
We were contenders, we're throwing the fight</br>
But I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe,</br>
I just wanna believe, in us.</br>
</br>
Oh, we're so c-c-c-c-c-controversial.</br>
We are entirely smooth.</br>
We admit to the truth,</br>
We are the best at what we do.</br>
And these are the words you wish you wrote down.</br>
This is the way you wish your voice sounds,</br>
Handsome and smart.</br>
Oh my tongue's the only muscle on my body</br>
That works harder than my heart.</br>
And its all from watching TV,</br>
And from speeding up my breathing.</br>
Wouldn't stop if I could.</br>
Oh it hurts to be this good.</br>
You're holding on to your grudge.</br>
Oh it hurts to always have to be honest</br>
With the one that you love.</br>
Oh, so let it go..</br>
</br>
We're concentrating on falling apart.</br>
We were contenders, we're throwing the fight</br>
But I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe,</br>
I just wanna believe.</br>
We're concentrating on falling apart.</br>
We were contenders, we're throwing the fight</br>
But I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe,</br>
I just wanna believe, in us.</br>
</br>
This is the grace that only we can bestow.</br>
This is the price you pay for loss of control.</br>
This is the break in the bend,</br>
This is the closest of calls.</br>
This is the reason you're alone,</br>
This is the rise and the fall.</br>
</br>
We're concentrating on falling apart.</br>
We were contenders, we're throwing the fight</br>
