				<h4> Lyrics </h4>
				<p><input type="button" value="Show" onclick="this.value = showElement('lyrics1')">No Good Deed<div id="lyrics1" style="display: none";> 
					Fiyero!</br>
					Eleka nahmen nahmen</br>
					Ah tum ah tum eleka nahmen</br>
					Eleka nahmen nahmen</br>
					Ah tum ah tum eleka nahmen</br></br>

					Let his flesh not be torn</br>
					Let his blood leave no stain</br>
					Though they beat him</br>
					Let him feel no pain</br>
					Let his bones never break</br>
					And however they try</br>
					To destroy him</br>
					Let him never die...</br>
					Let him never die...</br></br>

					Eleka nahmen nahmen</br>
					Ah tum ah tum eleka nahmen</br>
					Eleka nahmen nahmen</br>
					Ah tum ah tum eleka: eleka:</br></br>

					What good is this chanting?</br>
					I don't even know what I'm reading!</br>
					I don't even know what trick I ought to try</br>
					Fiyero, where are you?</br>
					Already dead, or bleeding?</br>
					One more disaster I can add to my</br>
					Generous supply?</br></br>

					No good deed goes unpunished</br>
					No act of charity goes unresented</br>
					No good deed goes unpunished</br>
					That's my new creed</br>
					My road of good intentions</br>
					Led where such roads always lead</br>
					No good deed</br>
					Goes unpunished!</br></br>

					Nessa</br>
					Doctor Dillamond</br>
					Fiyero</br>
					Fiyero!!</br></br>

					One question haunts and hurts</br>
					Too much, too much to mention:</br>
					Was I really seeking good</br>
					Or just seeking attention?</br>
					Is that all good deeds are</br>
					When looked at with an ice-cold eye?</br>
					If that's all good deeds are</br>
					Maybe that's the reason why</br></br>

					No good deed goes unpunished</br>
					All helpful urges should be circumvented</br>
					No good deed goes unpunished</br>
					Sure, I meant well -</br>
					Well, look at what well-meant did:</br>
					All right, enough - so be it</br>
					So be it, then:</br>
					Let all Oz be agreed</br>
					I'm wicked through and through</br>
					Since I can not succeed</br>
					Fiyero, saving you</br>
					I promise no good deed</br>
					Will I attempt to do again</br>
					Ever again</br>
					No good deed</br>
					Will I do again!</div></p>

						In sleep he sang to me</br>
						In dreams he came</br>
						That voice which calls to me and speaks my name</br>
						And do I dream again for now I find</br>
						The Phantom of the Opera is there</br>
						Inside my mind</br></br>

						Sing once again with me</br>
						Our strange duet</br>
						My power over you grows stronger yet</br>
						And though you turn from me to glance behind</br>
						The Phantom of the Opera is there</br>
						Inside your mind.</br></br>

						Those who have seen your face</br>
						Draw back in fear</br>
						I am the mask you wear</br></br>

						It's me they hear...</br></br>

						Your/My spirit and my/your voice in one combined</br>
						The Phantom of the Opera is there/here</br>
						Inside my/your mind</br></br>

						He's there, the phantom of the opera!</br>
						Beware, the phantom of the opera!</br>
						He's there, the phantom of the opera!</br>
						Beware the phantom of the opera!</br></br>

						In all your fantasies, you always knew</br>
						that man and mystery</br></br>

						Were both in you</br></br>

						And in this labyrinth</br>
						where night is blind</br>
						the Phantom of the Opera is there/here,</br>
						inside my/your mind</br></br>

						He's there, the phantom of the opera</br></br>

						Sing, my Angel of Music</br>
						Sing, my Angel</br>
						Sing for me</br>
						Sing, my Angel!</br>
						Sing for me!

						On my own</br>
						Pretending he's beside me</br>
						All alone</br>
						I walk with him till morning</br>
						Without him</br>
						I feel his arms around me</br>
						And when I lose my way I close my eyes</br>
						And he has found me</br></br>

						In the rain the pavement shines like silver</br>
						All the lights are misty in the river</br>
						In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight</br>
						And all I see is him and me forever and forever</br></br>

						And I know it's only in my mind</br>
						That I'm talking to myself and not to him</br>
						And although I know that he is blind</br>
						Still I say, there's a way for us</br></br>

						I love him</br>
						But when the night is over</br>
						He is gone</br>
						The river's just a river</br>
						Without him</br>
						The world around me changes</br>
						The trees are bare and everywhere</br>
						The streets are full of strangers</br></br>

						I love him</br>
						But every day I'm learning</br>
						All my life</br>
						I've only been pretending</br>
						Without me</br>
						His world will go on turning</br>
						A world that's full of happiness</br>
						That I have never known</br></br>

						I love him</br>
						I love him</br>
						I love him</br>
						But only on my own

							This is the end</br>
							Hold your breath and count to ten</br>
							Feel the earth move and then</br>
							Hear my heart burst again</br></br>

							For this is the end</br>
							I've drowned and dreamt this moment</br>
							So overdue I owe them</br>
							Swept away, I'm stolen</br></br>

							Let the sky fall</br>
							When it crumbles</br>
							We will stand tall</br>
							Face it all together</br></br>

							Let the sky fall</br>
							When it crumbles</br>
							We will stand tall</br>
							Face it all together</br>
							At skyfall</br>
							That skyfall</br></br>

							Skyfall is where we start</br>
							A thousand miles and poles apart</br>
							Where worlds collide and days are dark</br>
							You may have my number, you can take my name</br>
							But you'll never have my heart</br></br>

							Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)</br>
							When it crumbles (when it crumbles)</br>
							We will stand tall (we will stand tall)</br>
							Face it all together [x2]</br></br>

							At skyfall</br></br>

							(Let the sky fall</br>
							When it crumbles</br>
							We will stand tall) [x2]</br></br>

							Where you go I go</br>
							What you see I see</br>
							I know I'd never be me</br>
							Without the security</br>
							Of your loving arms</br>
							Keeping me from harm</br>
							Put your hand in my hand</br>
							And we'll stand</br></br>

							Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)</br>
							When it crumbles (when it crumbles)</br>
							We will stand tall (we will stand tall)</br>
							Face it all together [x2]</br></br>

							At skyfall</br></br>

							Let the sky fall</br>
							We will stand tall</br>
							At skyfall</br>

								Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity</br>
								To seize everything you ever wanted. one moment</br>
								Would you capture it or just let it slip?</br>
								Yo</br></br>

								His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy</br>
								There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti</br>
								He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs,</br>
								But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down,</br>
								The whole crowd goes so loud</br>
								He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out</br>
								He's choking how, everybody's joking now</br>
								The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!</br>
								Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity</br>
								Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked</br>
								He's so mad, but he won't give up that</br>
								Easy, no</br>
								He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes</br>
								It don't matter, he's dope</br>
								He knows that but he's broke</br>
								He's so stagnant, he knows</br>
								When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's</br>
								Back to the lab again, yo</br>
								This whole rhapsody</br>
								He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him</br></br>

								[Hook:]</br>
								You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</br>
								You own it, you better never let it go</br>
								You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</br>
								This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo</br>
								You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</br>
								You own it, you better never let it go</br>
								You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</br>
								This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo</br>
								(You better)</br></br>

								The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping</br>
								This world is mine for the taking</br>
								Make me king, as we move toward a new world order</br>
								A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem</br>
								It only grows harder, homie grows hotter</br>
								He blows. It's all over. These hoes is all on him</br>
								Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter</br>
								Lonely roads, God only knows</br>
								He's grown farther from home, he's no father</br>
								He goes home and barely knows his own daughter</br>
								But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water</br>
								His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product</br>
								They moved on to the next schmoe who flows</br>
								He nose dove and sold nada</br>
								So the soap opera is told and unfolds</br>
								I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on</br>
								Da da dum da dum da da</br></br>

								[Hook]</br></br>
								
							No more games, I'ma change what you call rage</br>
							Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged</br>
							I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed</br>
							I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage</br>
							But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher</br>
							Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper</br>
							All the pain inside amplified by the fact</br>
							That I can't get by with my 9 to 5</br>
							And I can't provide the right type of life for my family</br>
							Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers</br>
							And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life</br>
							And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder</br>
							Trying to feed and water my seed, plus</br>
							Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna</br>
							Baby mama drama's screaming on and</br>
							Too much for me to wanna</br>
							Stay in one spot, another day of monotony</br>
							Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail</br>
							I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot</br>
							Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not</br>
							Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go</br>
							I cannot grow old in Salem's lot</br>
							So here I go it's my shot.</br>
							Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got</br></br>

							[Hook]</br></br>

							You can do anything you set your mind to, man

							Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow</br>

							Just thinkin' about tomorrow</br>
							Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow 'til there's none</br></br>

							When I'm stuck in the day that's grey and lonely</br>
							I just stick up my chin and grin and say, oh</br></br>

							The sun'll come out tomorrow</br>
							So you gotta hang on</br>

							Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya, tomorrow</br>

								I can show you the world</br>
								Shining, shimmering, splendid</br>
								Tell me, princess, now when did</br>
								You last let your heart decide?</br></br>

								I can open your eyes</br>
								Take you wonder by wonder</br>
								Over, sideways and under</br>
								On a magic carpet ride</br></br>

								A whole new world</br>
								A new fantastic point of view</br>
								No one to tell us no or where to go</br>
								Or say we're only dreaming</br></br>

								A whole new world</br>
								A dazzling place I never knew</br>
								But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear</br>
								That now I'm in a whole new world with you</br>
								(Now I'm in a whole new world with you)</br>
								Unbelievable sights</br>
								Indescribable feelings</br>
								Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling</br>
								Through an endless diamond sky</br></br>

								A whole new world</br>
								(Don't you dare close your eyes)</br>
								A hundred thousand things to see</br>
								(Hold your breath, it gets better)</br></br>

								I'm like a shooting star</br>
								I've come so far</br>
								I can't go back</br>
								To where I used to be</br></br>

								A whole new world</br>
								Every turn a surprise</br></br>

								With new horizons to pursue</br>
								Every moment gets better</br>
								I'll chase them anywhere</br>
								There's time to spare</br>
								Let me share this whole new world with you</br></br>

								A whole new world</br>
								A whole new world</br>
								That's where we'll be</br>
								That's where we'll be</br>
								A thrilling place</br>
								A wondrous place</br>
								For you and me

								The snow glows white on the mountain tonight</br>
								Not a footprint to be seen</br>
								A kingdom of isolation,</br>
								And it looks like I'm the queen.</br></br>

								The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside</br>
								Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried!</br></br>

								Don't let them in, don't let them see</br>
								Be the good girl you always have to be</br>
								Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know</br>
								Well, now they know!</br></br>

								Let it go, let it go</br>
								Can't hold it back anymore</br>
								Let it go, let it go</br>
								Turn away and slam the door!</br></br>

								I don't care</br>
								What they're going to say</br>
								Let the storm rage on,</br>
								The cold never bothered me anyway!</br></br>

								It's funny how some distance</br>
								Makes everything seem small</br>
								And the fears that once controlled me</br>
								Can't get to me at all!</br></br>

								It's time to see what I can do</br>
								To test the limits and break through</br>
								No right, no wrong, no rules for me I'm free!</br></br>

								Let it go, let it go</br>
								I am one with the wind and sky</br>
								Let it go, let it go</br>
								You'll never see me cry!</br></br>

								Here I stand</br>
								And here I'll stay</br>
								Let the storm rage on!</br></br>

								My power flurries through the air into the ground</br>
								My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around</br>
								And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast</br>
								I'm never going back,</br>
								The past is in the past!</br></br>

								Let it go, let it go</br>
								And I'll rise like the break of dawn</br>
								Let it go, let it go</br>
								That perfect girl is gone!</br></br>

								Here I stand</br>
								In the light of day</br>
								Let the storm rage on,</br>
								The cold never bothered me anyway!
