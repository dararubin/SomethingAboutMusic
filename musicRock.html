					Big wheels keep on turning </br>
					Carry me home to see my kin </br>
					Singing songs about the Southland </br>
					I miss Alabamy once again </br>
					And I think its a sin, yes</br></br>

					Well I heard mister Young sing about her </br>
					Well, I heard ole Neil put her down </br>
					Well, I hope Neil Young will remember </br>
					A Southern man don't need him around anyhow</br></br>

					Sweet home Alabama </br>
					Where the skies are so blue </br>
					Sweet Home Alabama </br>
					Lord, I'm coming home to you</br></br>

					In Birmingham they love the gov' nor (boo, boo, boo)</br>
					Now we all did what we could do </br>
					Now Watergate does not bother me </br>
					Does your conscience bother you? </br>
					Tell the truth</br></br>

					Sweet home Alabama </br>
					Where the skies are so blue </br>
					Sweet Home Alabama </br>
					Lord, I'm coming home to you </br>
					Here I come Alabama</br></br>

					Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers </br>
					And they've been known to pick a song or two </br>
					Lord they get me off so much </br>
					They pick me up when I'm feeling blue </br>
					Now how about you?</br></br>

					Sweet home Alabama </br>
					Where the skies are so blue </br>
					Sweet Home Alabama </br>
					Lord, I'm coming home to you</br></br>

					Sweet home Alabama </br>
					Oh sweet home baby </br>
					Where the skies are so blue </br>
					And the guv'nor's true </br>
					Sweet Home Alabama </br>
					Lordy </br>
					Lord, I'm coming home to you </br>
					Yea, yea Montgomery's got the answer

					It kills me not to know this but I've all but just forgotten</br>
					What the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them</br>
					As the telling signs of age rain down a single tear is dropping</br>
					Through the valleys of an aging face that this world has forgotten</br></br>

					There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place</br>
					And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds</br>
					But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you</br>
					Like walls that we just can't break through until we disappear</br></br>

					So tell me now</br>
					If this ain't love then how do we get out?</br>
					Because I don't know</br>
					That's when she said I don't hate you boy</br>
					I just want to save you while there's still something left to save (whoa, whoa)</br>
					That's when I told her I love you girl</br>
					But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have (whoa, whoa)</br></br>

					But the day pressed on like crushing weights</br>
					For no man does it ever wait</br>
					Like memories of dying days</br>
					That deafen us like hurricanes</br>
					Bathed in flames we held the brand</br>
					Uncurled the fingers in your hand</br>
					Pressed into the flesh like sand</br>
					Now do you understand?</br></br>

					So tell me now</br>
					If this ain't love then how do we get out?</br>
					Because I don't know</br>
					That's when she said I don't hate you boy</br>
					I just want to save you while there's still something left to save (whoa, whoa)</br>
					That's when I told her I love you girl</br>
					But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have (whoa, whoa)</br></br>

					One thousand miles away</br>
					There's nothing left to say</br>
					But so much left that I don't know</br>
					We never had a choice</br>
					This world is too much noise</br>
					It takes me under</br>
					It takes me under once again</br>
					I don't hate you</br>
					I don't hate you, no</br></br>

					So tell me now</br>
					If this ain't love then how do we get out?</br>
					Because I don't know</br>
					That's when she said I don't hate you boy</br>
					I just want to save you while there's still something left to save (whoa, whoa)</br>
					That's when I told her I love you girl</br>
					But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have (whoa, whoa)</br></br>

					I don't hate you</br>
					I don't hate you (whoa, whoa)</br>
					I don't hate you</br>
					I don't hate you, no (whoa, whoa)
