					I'll never settle down, </br>
					That's what I always thought</br>
					Yeah, I was that kind of man, </br>
					just ask anyone</br></br>

					I don't dance, But here I am</br>
					Spinning you around and around in circles</br>
					It ain't my style, but I don't care</br>
					I'd do anything with you anywhere</br>
					Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand</br>
					Cause, I don't dance</br></br>

					Love's never come my way, </br>
					I've never been this far</br>
					Cause you took these two left feet</br>
					And waltzed away with my heart</br></br>

					I don't dance, But here I am</br>
					Spinning you around and around in circles</br>
					It Ain't my style, but I don't care</br>
					I'd do anything with you anywhere</br>
					Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl</br>
					Cause, I don't dance</br></br>
					Ohhh
					I don't dance</br></br>

					Ooh</br></br>

					I don't dance, But here I am</br>
					Spinning you around and around in circles</br>
					It ain't my style, but I don't care</br>
					I'd do anything with you anywhere</br></br>

					Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.</br>
					Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze.</br>
					Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.</br>
					West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.</br></br>

					All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.</br>
					Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.</br>
					Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.</br>
					West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.</br></br>

					I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me, the radio reminds me of my home far away.</br>
					And driving down the road I get a feeling that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.</br>
					Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.</br></br>
					West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.</br>
					Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.</br>

					I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon</br>
					A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun</br>
					I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A</br>
					I'm getting drunk on a plane</br></br>

					I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy</br>
					Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me</br>
					Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays</br>
					I'm getting drunk on a plane</br></br>

					Buyin' drinks for everybody</br>
					But the pilot, it's a party</br>
					Got this 737 rocking like a G6</br>
					Stewardess is somethin' sexy</br>
					Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey</br>
					Told her about my condition</br>
					Got a little mile-high flight attention</br>
					It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds</br>
					I'm up so high, I may never come down</br>
					I'll try anything to drown out the pain</br>
					They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane</br></br>

					We had this date marked on the calendar forever</br>
					We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together</br>
					I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake</br>
					So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane</br></br>

					Buyin' drinks for everybody</br>
					But the pilot, it's a party</br>
					Got this 737 rocking like a G6</br>
					Stewardess is somethin' sexy</br>
					Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey</br>
					Told her about my condition</br>
					Got a little mile-high flight attention</br>
					It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds</br>
					I'm up so high, I may never come down</br>
					I'll try anything to drown out the pain</br>
					They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane</br></br>

					On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class</br>
					So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass</br>
					And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass</br>
					'Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane</br></br>

					Buyin' drinks for everybody</br>
					But the pilot, it's a party</br>
					Got this 737 rocking like a G6</br>
					Stewardess is somethin' sexy</br>

					I'm getting drunk on a plane</br>
					I might be passed out</br>
					In the baggage claim</br>
					But right now</br>
					I'm drunk on a plane

					She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate</br>
					Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate</br>
					I was lookin' for her boyfriend</br>
					Thinkin', no way she ain't got one</br>
					Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love</br>
					Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup</br>
					Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck</br>
					She jumped up and cut me off</br></br>

					She was like, oh my God, this is my song</br>
					I've been listenin' to the radio all night long</br>
					Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is</br>
					She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance</br>
					'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand</br>
					Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out</br>
					And she gave me a kiss</br>
					And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again</br>
					And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again</br></br>

					I'd gave that DJ my last dime</br>
					If he would have played it just one more time</br>
					But a little while later</br>
					We were sittin' in the drive in my truck</br>
					Before I walked her to the door</br>
					I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too</br>
					But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove</br>
					Man, you should have seen her light up</br></br>

					She was like, oh my God, this is my song</br>
					We've been listenin' to the radio all night long</br>
					I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is</br>
					She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance</br>
					'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand</br>
					Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss</br>
					And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again</br>
					And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again</br></br>

					The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars</br>
					You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar</br></br>

					She was like, oh my God, this is my song</br>
					I've been listenin' to the radio all night long</br>
					Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is</br>
					She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance</br>
					'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand</br>
					Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss</br>
					And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again</br>
					And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again</br></br>

					Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again</br>
					Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again</br>

					8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home</br>
					All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone</br>
					Saying come on he ain't worth the pain</br>
					Do what you gotta do to forget his name</br></br>

					Now there's only one thing left for me to do</br>
					Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots</br>
					Check the mirror one last time</br>
					And kiss the past goodbye</br></br>

					What I'm really needing now</br>
					Is a double shot of Crown</br>
					Chase that disco ball around</br>
					'Til I don't remember</br>
					Go until they cut me off</br>
					Wanna get a little lost</br>
					In the noise, in the lights</br></br>

					Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight</br>
					'Til the party and the music and the truth collide</br>
					Bring it 'til his memory fades away</br>
					Hey bartender</br></br>

					Tonight I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor</br>
					Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more</br>
					But before it goes too far</br>
					I'll let him down easy</br>
					'Cause tonight it's all about</br>
					Dancing with my girls to the DJ</br>
					Put that song on replay</br></br>

					What I'm really needing now</br>

					Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight</br>
					'Til the party and the music and the truth collide</br>
					Bring it 'til his memory fades away</br>
					Hey bartender</br></br>

					I'm feeling that buzz</br>
					I'm ready to rock</br>
					Ain't no way I’m gonna tell you to stop</br>
					So pour that thing up to the top</br>
					I'm coming in hot</br></br>

					Gonna put the the world away for a minute </br>
					Pretend I don't live in it </br>
					Sunshine gonna wash my blues away </br></br>

					Had sweet love but I lost it </br>
					She got too close so I fought her </br>
					Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way </br></br>

					Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere </br>
					Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair </br>
					Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair </br>
					Sunrise there's a fire in the sky </br>
					Never been so happy </br>
					Never felt so high </br>
					And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise </br></br>

					Wrote a note said be back in a minute </br>
					Bought a boat and I sailed off in it </br>
					Don't think anybody gonna miss me anyway </br></br>

					Mind on a permanent vacation </br>
					The ocean is my only medication </br>
					Wishing my condition ain't ever gonna go away </br></br>

					Cause now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere </br>
					Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair </br>
					Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair </br>
					Sunrise there's a fire in the sky </br></br>

					Never been so happy </br>
					Never felt so high </br>
					And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise </br></br>

					This champagne shore washing over me </br>
					It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea </br>
					One day you could be as lost as me </br>
					Change you're geography </br>
					Maybe you might be </br></br>

					Knee deep in the water somewhere </br>
					Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair </br>
					Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair </br>
					Sunrise there's a fire in the sky </br>
					Never been so happy </br>
					Never felt so high </br>
					And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise </br></br>

					Come on in the water it's nice </br>
					Find yourself a little slice </br>
					Grab a backpack of lies </br>
					You never know until you try </br>
					When you lose yourself </br>
					You find the key to paradise
