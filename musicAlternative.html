					Days swiftly come and go.</br>
					I'm dreaming of her</br>
					She's seeing other guys</br>
					Emotions they stir</br>
					The sun is gone.</br>
					The nights are long</br>
					And I am left while the tears fall.</br></br>

					Did you think that I would cry, on the phone?</br>
					Do you know what it feels like, being alone?</br>
					I'll find someone new</br></br>

					(Swing) Swing, Swing from the tangles of</br>
					My heart is crushed by a former love</br>
					Can you help me find a way</br>
					To carry on again.</br></br>

					Wish cast into the sky</br>
					I'm moving on</br>
					Sweet beginnings do arise</br>
					She knows I was wrong</br>
					The notes are old,</br>
					They bend, they fold</br>
					and so do I to a new love.</br></br>

					Did you think that I would cry, on the phone?</br>
					Do you know what it feels like, being alone? </br>
					I'll find someone new</br></br>

					(Swing) Swing, Swing from the tangles of</br>
					My heart is crushed by a former love</br>
					Can you help me find a way</br>
					To carry on again</br></br>

					Bury me</br>
					(you thought your problems were gone)</br>
					Carry me</br>
					(away. away, away...)</br></br>

					(Swing) Swing, Swing from the tangles of</br>
					My heart is crushed by a former love</br>
					Can you help me find a way</br>
					To carry on again

					We lifted this house we lifted this house</br></br>

					Fire-crackers in the east my car parked south</br>
					Your hands on my cheeks your shoulder in my mouth</br>
					I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine</br>
					We rattle this town we rattle this scene</br></br>

					O, Anna Sun!</br>
					O, Anna Sun!</br></br>

					What do you know? this house is falling apart</br>
					What can I say? this house is falling apart</br>
					We got no money, but we got heart</br>

					To fill the night with hollering</br>
					When your eyes are red</br>
					And emptiness is all you know</br>
					With the darkness fed</br>
					I will be your scarecrow</br></br>

					Say, hey!</br></br>

					Hear the sound of the falling rain</br>

					The shame</br>
					The ones who died without a name</br></br>

					Hear the dogs howling out of key</br>
					To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (Hey!)</br>
					And bleed, the company lost the war today</br></br>

					I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies</br>
					This is the dawning of the rest of our lives</br>
					On holiday</br></br>

					Hear the drum pounding out of time</br>
					Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)</br>
					To find, the money's on the other side</br></br>

					Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)</br>
					There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)</br>
					A gag, a plastic bag on a monument</br></br>

					I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies</br>
					This is the dawning of the rest of our lives</br>
					On holiday</br></br>

					(Hey!)</br>
					(Say, hey!)</br></br>

					"The representative from California has the floor"</br></br>

					Zieg Heil to the president Gasman</br>
					Bombs away is your punishment</br>
					Pulverize the Eiffel towers</br>
					Who criticize your government</br>
					Bang bang goes the broken glass and</br>
					Kill all the fags that don't agree</br>
					Trials by fire, setting fire</br>
					Is not a way that's meant for me</br>
					Just cause (hey, hey, hey), just cause, because we're outlaws yeah!</br></br>

					Boulevard of Broken Dreams:</br></br>
					I walk a lonely road</br>
					The only one that I have ever known</br>
					Don't know where it goes</br>
					But it's home to me and I walk alone</br></br>

					I walk this empty street</br>
					On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams</br>

					My shadow's the only one that walks beside me</br>
					My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating</br>
					Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me</br>
					'Til then I walk alone</br></br>

					Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah,
					Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah</br></br>

					I'm walking down the line</br>
					That divides me somewhere in my mind</br>
					On the border line</br>
					Of the edge and where I walk alone</br></br>

					Read between the lines</br>
					Of what's fucked up and everything's alright</br>
					Check my vital signs</br>
					To know I'm still alive and I walk alone</br></br>

					This is morning</br>
					That's when I spend the most time</br>
					Thinking 'bout what I've given up</br>
					This is a warning</br>
					When you start the day just to close the curtains</br>
					You're thinking 'bout what I've given up</br></br>

					Where are you now?</br>
					As I'm swimming through the stereo</br>
					I'm writing you a symphony of sound</br>
					Where are you now?</br>
					As I rearrange the songs again</br>
					This mix could burn a hole in anyone</br>
					But it was you I was thinking of</br></br>

					I read your letter</br>
					The one you left when you broke into my house</br>
					Retracing every step you made</br>
					And you said you meant it</br>
					And there's a piece of me in every single</br>
					Second of every single day</br>
					But if it's true then tell me how it got this way</br></br>

					Where are you now?</br>
					As I'm swimming through the stereo</br>
					I'm writing you a symphony of sound</br>
					Where are you now?</br>
					As I rearrange the songs again</br>
					This mix could burn a hole in anyone</br>
					But it was you I was thinking of</br></br>

					And I can't get to you</br>
					I can't get to you</br>
					I can't get to you (you, you)</br></br>

					Where are you now?</br>
					As I'm swimming through the stereo</br>
					I conduct a symphony of sound</br>
					Where are you now?</br>
					As I'm cutting through you track by track</br>
					I swear to God this mix could sink the sun</br>
					But it was you I was thinking of</br></br>

					And where are you now?</br>
					And where are you now?</br></br>

					And this is my mixed tape for her</br>
					It's like I wrote every note</br>
					With my own fingers

					I never thought I'd die alone</br>
					I laughed the loudest who'd have known?</br>
					I traced the cord back to the wall</br>
					No wonder it was never plugged in at all</br>
					I took my time, I hurried up</br>
					The choice was mine I didn't think enough</br>
					I'm too depressed to go on</br>
					You'll be sorry when I'm gone</br></br>

					I never conquered, rarely came</br>
					16 just held such better days</br>
					Days when I still felt alive</br>
					We couldn't wait to get outside</br>
					The world was wide, too late to try</br>
					The tour was over we'd survived</br>
					I couldn't wait till I got home</br>
					To pass the time in my room alone</br></br>

					I never thought I'd die alone</br>
					Another six months I'll be unknown</br>
					Give all my things to all my friends</br>
					You'll never step foot in my room again</br>
					You'll close it off, board it up</br>
					Remember the time that I spilled the cup</br>
					Of apple juice in the hall</br>
					Please tell mom this is not her fault</br></br>

					I never conquered, rarely came</br>
					16 just held such better days</br>
					Days when I still felt alive</br>
					We couldn't wait to get outside</br>
					The world was wide, too late to try</br>
					The tour was over we'd survived</br>
					I couldn't wait till I got home</br>
					To pass the time in my room alone</br></br>

					I never conquered, rarely came</br>
					Tomorrow holds such better days</br>
					Days when I can still feel alive</br>
					When I can't wait to get outside</br>
					The world is wide, the time goes by</br>
					The tour is over, I've survived</br>
					I can't wait till I get home</br>
					To pass the time in my room alone

					Tie a noose around your mind loose enough to breathe fine and tie it,</br>

					Entertain my faith. [x10]</br></br>

					Lean with it, rock with it,</br>
					When we gonna stop with it,</br>
					Lyrics that mean nothing, we were gifted with thought,</br>
					Is it time to move our feet to an introspective beat,</br>
					It ain't the speakers that bump hearts, it's our hearts that make the beat. [x4]</br></br>
