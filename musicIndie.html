					I'm wasted, losing time</br>
					I'm a foolish, fragile spine</br>
					I want all that is not mine</br>
					I want him but we're not right </br></br>

					In the darkness I will meet my creators</br>
					And they will all agree, that I'm a suffocator</br></br>

					I should go now quietly</br>
					For my bones have found a place</br>
					to lie down and sleep</br>
					Where all my layers can become reeds</br>
					All my limbs can become trees</br>
					All my children can become me</br>
					What at mess I leave</br>
					To follow [x4]</br></br>

					In the darkness I will meet my creators</br>
					They will all agree, I'm a suffocator</br></br>

					Suffocator [x2]</br></br>
					Oh no</br>
					I'm sorry if I smothered you [x2]</br>
					I sometimes wish I'd stayed inside</br>
					My mother</br>
					Never to come out

				<p><input type="button" value="Show" onclick="this.value = showElement('lyrics2')">Skinny Love<div id="lyrics2" style="display: none";> 
					Come on skinny love just last the year,</br>
					Pour a little salt we were never here,</br>
					My my my, my my my, my-my my-my...</br>
					Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer.</br></br>

					Tell my love to wreck it all,</br>
					Cut out all the ropes and let me fall,</br>
					My my my, my my my, my-my my-my...</br>
					Right in the moment this order's tall.</br></br>

					And I told you to be patient,</br>
					And I told you to be fine,</br>
					And I told you to be balanced,</br>
					And I told you to be kind,</br>
					And in the morning I'll be with you,</br>
					But it will be a different kind,</br>
					'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets,</br>
					And you'll be owning all the fines.</br></br>

					Come on skinny love, what happened here?</br>
					Suckle on the hope in light brassieres,</br>
					My my my, my my my, my-my my-my...</br>
					Sullen load is full, so slow on the split.</br></br>

					And I told you to be patient,</br>
					And I told you to be fine,</br>
					And I told you to be balanced,</br>
					And I told you to be kind,</br>
					And now all your love is wasted,</br>
					Then who the hell was I?</br>
					'Cause now I'm breaking at the britches,</br>
					And at the end of all your lines.</br></br>

					Who will love you?</br>
					Who will fight?</br>
					And who will fall far behind?</br></br>

					Come on skinny love,</br>
					My my my, my my my, my-my my-my...</br>
					My my my, my my my, my-my my-my.</br>

					I want you by my side</br>
					So that I never feel alone again</br>
					They've always been so kind</br>
					But now they've brought you away from me</br>
					I hope they didn't get your mind</br>
					Your heart is too strong, anyway</br>
					We need to fetch back the time</br>
					They have stolen from us</br></br>

					I want you</br>
					We can bring it on the floor</br>
					You've never danced like this before</br>
					We don't talk about it</br>
					Dancing on, do the boogie all night long</br>
					Stoned in paradise</br>
					Shouldn't talk about it [x2]</br></br>

					Shouldn't talk about it</br></br>

					Coldest winter for me</br>
					No sun is shining anymore</br>
					The only thing I feel is pain</br>
					Caused by absence of you</br>
					Suspense controlling my mind</br>
					I cannot find the way out of here</br></br>

					I want you by my side</br>
					So that I never feel alone again</br></br>

					I want you</br>
					We can bring it on the floor</br>
					You've never danced like this before</br>
					We don't talk about it</br>
					Dancing on, do the boogie all night long</br>
					Stoned in paradise</br>
					Shouldn't talk about it [x2]</br></br>

					In the morning when I wake</br>
					And the sun is coming through,</br>
					Oh, you fill my lungs with sweetness,</br>
					And you fill my head with you.</br></br>

					Shall I write it in a letter?</br>
					Shall I try to get it down?</br>
					Oh, you fill my head with pieces</br>
					Of a song I can't get out.</br></br>

					Can I be close to you?</br>
					Ooh-oo-oo-ooh, ooh</br>
					Can I be close to you?</br>
					Ooh, ooh.</br></br>

					Can I take it to a morning</br>
					Where the fields are painted gold</br>
					And the trees are filled with memories</br>
					Of the feelings never told?</br></br>

					When the evening pulls the sun down,</br>
					And the day is almost through,</br>
					Oh, the whole world it is sleeping,</br>
					But my world is you.</br></br>

					You used to get it in your fishnets</br>
					Now you only get it in your night dress</br>
					Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness</br>
					Landed in a very common crisis</br>
					Everything's in order in a black hole</br>
					Nothing seems as pretty as the past though</br>
					That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco</br>
					Remember when you used to be a rascal?</br></br>

					Oh the boy's a slag</br>
					The best you ever had</br>
					The best you ever had</br>
					Is just a memory and those dreams</br>
					Weren't as daft as they seem</br>
					As daft as they seem</br>
					My love when you dream them up...</br></br>

					Flicking through a little book of sex tips</br>
					Remember when the boys were all electric?</br>
					And now when she's told she's gonna get it</br>
					I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it</br>
					Clinging to not getting sentimental</br>
					Said she wasn't going but she went still</br>
					Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle</br>
					Was it a Mecca Dobber or a betting pencil?</br></br>

					Oh the boy's a slag</br>

					Oh, Flo, where did you go?</br>
					Where did you go?</br>
					Where did you go? Whoa.</br></br>

					You're falling about</br>
					You took a left off Last Laugh Lane</br>
					You're just sounding it out</br>
					But you're not coming back again. [x2]</br></br>

					In a few weeks I will get time</br>

					And I can't say it's what you know</br>
					But you've known it the whole time,</br>
					Yeah, you've known it the whole time</br></br>

					Maybe next year I'll have no time</br>
					To think about the questions to address</br>
					Am I the one to try to stop the fire?</br></br>

					I wouldn't test you, I'm not the best you could have attained</br>
					Why try anything?</br>

					When the wind picked up the fire spread</br>
					And the grapevines seemed left for dead.</br>
					And the northern sky, like the end of day,</br>
					The end of days.</br></br>

					A wake up call to a rented room</br>
					Sounded like an alarm of impending doom.</br>
					To warn us it's only a matter of time.</br></br>

					Before we all burn [4x]</br></br>

					We bought some wine and some papercups</br>
					Near your daughter's school when we picked her up</br>
					And drove to a cemetery on a hill</br>
					On a hill.</br></br>

					And we watched the plumes paint the sky gray</br>
					And she laughed and danced through the field of graves</br>
					There I knew it would be alright</br>
					That everything would be alright,</br>
					Would be alright</br>
					Would be alright</br>
					Would be alright.</br></br>

					And the news reports on the radio</br>
					Said it was getting worse</br>
					As the ocean air fanned the flame.</br>
					But I couldn't think of anywhere I would have rather been</br>
					To watch it all burn away.</br>
					To burn away.</br></br>

					The firemen worked in double shifts,</br>
					With prayers for rain on their lips</br>
					And they knew it was only a matter of time.
