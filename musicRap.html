					Fuck you if you love a car for its paint job</br>
					Love you if you love a car for the road trips</br>
					Show me the miles and your arms and the pink scar</br>
					Where the doctor had to pull out all the bone chips</br>
					Cuz you were pressing on the gas just a bit hard</br>
					Right in the moment where the road curved a bit sharp</br>
					And when you woke up, somebody was unclipping your seat belt </br>
					and pulling you from the open window of your flipped car</br></br>

					Cold pizza</br>
					Tie-dye shirts</br>
					Broken hearts</br>
					Give'm here, give'm here</br>
					Hand me downs</br>
					Give me give me leftovers</br>
					Give me give me sloppy seconds</br>
					Give em here, give em here</br></br>

					I don't care where you've been</br>
					How many miles, I still love you [x2]</br></br>

					Show me someone who says they got no baggage</br>
					I'll show you somebody whose got no story</br>
					Nothing gory means no glory, but baby please don't bore me</br>
					We won't know until we get there</br>
					The who, or the what, or the when where</br>
					My favorite sweater was a present that I got a couple presidents ago</br>
					And I promised that I would rock it till it's thread bare</br>
					Bet on it</br>
					Every single person got a couple skeletons</br>
					So pretty soon, in this room</br>
					It'll just be me and you when we clear out all the elephants</br>
					Me and you and the elements</br></br>

					We all have our pitfalls</br>
					Beer's flat, the cabs have been called</br>
					And everybody and their momma can hear the drama </br>
					that's happening behind these thin walls</br></br>

					Cold pizza</br>
					Tie-dye shirts (tie-dye shirts)</br>
					Broken hearts</br>
					Give'm here, give'm here</br>
					Hand me downs (hand me downs)</br>
					Leftovers (leftovers)</br>
					Sloppy seconds</br>
					Give'm here, give'm here</br></br>

					I don't care where you've been</br>
					How many miles, I still love you (2x)</br></br>

					I don't care (cold pizza)</br>
					Where you've been (tie-dye shirts)</br>
					How many (broken hearts) miles, I still love you</br>
					I don't care (hand me downs)</br>
					Where you've been (left overs)</br>
					How many (sloppy seconds) miles, I still love you</br></br>

					My pattern with women isn't a flattering image</br>
					But I don't want to run away because I said so</br>
					I don't want to be the guy to hide all of my flaws</br>
					And I'll be giving you the side of me that I don't let show</br>
					Everything in fashion</br>
					That has ever happened</br>
					Always coming crashing down</br>
					Better let go</br>
					But in a couple years it will be retro</br>
					You rock Marc Ecko</br>
					My shirts have the gecko</br>
					Cuz in the past man, I was hopeless</br>
					But now's when my little cousins look the dopest</br>
					(whoop whoop)</br>
					Fuck the fashion po-po</br>
					Have a stale doughnut, I don't need no tips</br>
					Fuck a five second rule</br>
					That's a plan I never understood</br>
					It's September in my kitchen in a Christmas sweater</br>
					Sipping cold coffee on the phone with damaged goods</br></br>

					And there is not a single place that I would rather be</br>
					I'm fucked up just like you are, and you're fucked up just like me</br></br>

					Cold pizza (cold pizza)</br>
					Tie-dye shirts (tie-dye shirts)</br>
					Broken hearts</br>
					Give'm here, Give'm here</br>
					Hand me downs (oh hand me downs)</br>
					Give me give me leftovers (leftovers)</br>
					Give me give me sloppy seconds</br>
					Give'm here give'm here</br></br>

					I don't care where you've been</br>
					How many miles, I still love you [x2]</br></br>

					I don't care (cold pizza)</br>
					Where you've been (tie-dye shirts)</br>
					How many (broken hearts) miles, I still love you</br>
					I don't care (hand me downs)</br>
					Where you've been (left overs)</br>
					How many (sloppy seconds) miles, I still love you

					I, I, I, I, I want to love you</br>
					But if it's not right what can I do?</br>
					Everything will be alright</br>
					So baby get some sleep tonight</br></br>

					Uh, I wish we could just pretend to be</br>
					Like we always were before as happy as the Kennedy's</br>
					No one told Jackie about Marilyn's tendencies</br>
					Ignorance is bliss when you're married half a century</br>
					Life is too short, trying to hold it all together</br>
					It's gone before you know it but tonight could last forever</br>
					I wrote it out on paper but forgot to mail the letter</br>
					And you could walk away but you won't find nothing better</br>
					It's whatever, I just hope that you remember</br>
					Then I said some shit that upset her</br>
					Arguing in public, talking loud as Big sweater</br>
					She said, "You're always gone."</br>
					I said, "'The fuck do you expect from me?"</br>
					Then she look at me and she said to me</br></br>

					I, I, I, I, I want to love you</br>
					But if it's not right what can I do?</br>
					Everything will be alright</br>
					So baby get some sleep tonight</br></br>

					Uh, maybe in some other lifetime</br>
					Or somewhere down the road we might meet up at the right time</br>
					Girls come with the profession when you write rhymes</br>
					Caught me and she told me I'm a pig like I fight crime</br>
					Well, maybe G is just an asshole</br>
					Fuck around with bitches alphalpha, little rascal</br>
					I swear my intentions aren't as evil as you think</br>
					But temptation's always pushing people to the brink</br>
					Fuck, I always lose my judgement when I drink</br>
					My only wish is you would settle down and hear me out</br>
					I know I haven't been completely honest and devout</br>
					It's difficult for me, these girls try to seek me out</br>
					I try to talk it out but this is all she speak about</br>
					She said</br></br>

					I, I, I, I, I want to love you</br>
					But if it's not right what can I do?</br>
					Everything's gonna be alright</br>
					So baby get some sleep tonight</br></br>

					Uh, so if tonight turns out to be</br>
					The last night before you peaced then walked out on me</br>
					Let's let it all hang out like a balcony</br>
					One last time, the best is what you about to see</br>
					So make it worth it tonight, only so you know I never hurt you in spite</br>
					Love me like you never will again, it's our last time</br>
					Tonight forget about the pastime</br>
					Everything will be alright</br>
					So baby get some sleep tonight

					Hi, can I talk to Teresa?</br>
					Oh, this is her mom?</br>
					Oh, you Mother Teresa?</br>
					Aw, I like that.</br></br>

					Don't you tell me that it's all right</br>
					Because I'm anticipating a long night</br></br>

					Man,</br>
					I've been up so damn early that I'm sleepwalkin'</br>
					Now my eyes are looking like Macaulay Culkin's</br>
					Watch me roll around the city like I'm Steve Hawkins</br>
					These bitches Waka flock to us when we walk in</br>
					They wanna act like it's a big deal, Ron Burgundy</br>
					I'm underground but I'm poppin' up commercially</br>
					I keep it buzzing like I'm a fuckin' worker bee</br>
					So I'mma need a couple Gs if you want a verse with me</br>
					So let me take your pay check</br>
					Now you gotta find another way to pay rent</br>
					Your life sucks like the Ravens</br>
					You ain't been on a date yet</br>
					I take your girl to dinner</br>
					Then go home and have some great sex</br>
					Yeah, this gon' be a long night</br>
					I guarantee it, we probably gon' see the sunlight</br>
					Before our eyes wide shut I'mma make a couple bucks</br>
					And a couple hundred drinks, we about to turn it up, like...</br></br>

					Don't you tell me that it's all right</br>
					Because I'm anticipating a long night</br>
					Ooh, woah</br>
					Grab a Corona and pass out in the tub</br>
					And when I wake up everything will be all right, all right</br></br>

					Yeah, I keep on running 'til I'm red up in the face</br>
					Had a party at the crib, everyone was hella grate-ful</br>
					Wait a minute, got a bedroom full of strangers</br>
					I ain't talking Danny Granger, but I'm running out of Pacers</br>
					I mean patience, nah, nothing can phase us</br>
					I know you say your name but, my mind was on vacation</br>
					Can't track that down, too many chasers</br>
					I can't pack that crowd, too many lame-sters</br>
					So let's just kick it in the back of my apartment</br>
					Or at Madison Square Garden, we could go and watch the Rangers</br>
					Central Park where we could go until it's dark</br>
					And when somebody try to stalk you I just keep you out of danger</br>
					So come to the crib just hop in Benz first</br>
					I'm after the cat, but I don't mean Chesire</br>
					Uh, shout out to Pat, he look like a Hemsworth</br>
					I'm kickin' it with Chance so baby don't say the N-word</br></br>

					Don't you tell me that it's all right</br>
					Because I'm anticipating a long night</br>
					Ooh, woah</br>
					Grab a Corona and pass out in the tub</br>
					And when I wake up everything will be all right, all right</br></br>

					Chance? The rapper?</br></br>

					Ashin Ls in a hotel sink</br>
					Management swears that the hotel stink</br>
					Whole time I'm yellin hold up a minute while the doorbell rings</br>
					When old coke glistening on my nose earring</br>
					And niggas just tryna function 'til a nigga can't function</br>
					And the weed so pungent that I probably won't punch it</br>
					And imported in punches and they actin' inpugnant</br>
					With a rock and a pin and they say pin I'm actin' 100</br>
					And I turn up turn up turn up</br>
					Get high burn up burn up burn up</br>
					I'm fucked up and she's fucked up and</br>
					We not gon' remember tonight so</br>
					Let's fuck in a Wendy's bathroom</br>
					Get frosty, forget the Sprite</br></br>

					Don't you tell me that it's all right</br>
					Because I'm anticipating a long night</br>
					Ooh, woah</br>
					Grab a Corona and pass out in the tub</br>
					And when I wake up everything will be all right, all right

					We got a young brother to stand for something!</br>
					We got a young brother that believe in the all of us!</br>
					Brother Kendrick Lamar! He's not a rapper, he's a writer, he's an author!</br>
					And if you read between the lines, we'll learn how to love one another! But you can't do that</br>
					Right on</br>
					I said, you can't do that - without loving yourself first</br></br>

					I done been through a whole lot</br>
					Trial, tribulations, but I know God</br>
					Satan wanna put me in a bow-tie</br>
					Praying that the holy water don't go dry, yeah yeah</br>
					As I look around me</br>
					So many motherfuckers wanna down me</br>
					But ain't no nigga never drown me</br>
					In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me</br></br>

					And I love myself</br>
					(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs)</br>
					I love myself</br>
					(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)</br>
					I love myself</br>
					(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)</br>
					I love myself</br>
					(One day at the time, sun gone shine)</br></br>

					Everybody looking at you crazy (Crazy)</br>
					What you gone do? (What you gone do?)</br>
					Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)</br>
					Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you)</br>
					Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart</br>
					On my sleeve let the runway start</br>
					You know the miserable do love company</br>
					What do you want from me and my scars?</br>
					Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence</br>
					How many times our potential was anonymous?</br>
					How many times the city making me promises?</br>
					So I promise this</br></br>

					And I love myself</br>
					(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)</br>
					I love myself</br>
					(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)</br>
					I love myself</br>
					(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)</br>
					I love myself</br>
					(One day at the time, sun gone shine)</br></br>

					They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street</br>
					And a gun in the hood and a mob of police</br>
					And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends</br>
					And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme, yup</br>
					These days of frustration keep y'all on ducking rotation</br>
					I duck these gold faces, post up fee-fi-fo-fum basis</br>
					Dreams of realities peace</br>
					Blow steam in the face of the beast</br>
					The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now</br>
					The strong in me, I still smile</br></br>

					And I love myself</br>
					(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)</br>
					I love myself</br>
					(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)</br>
					I love myself</br>
					(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)</br>
					I love myself</br>
					(One day at the time, sun gone shine)</br></br>

					Walk my barefeet (Walk my barefeet)</br>
					Down, down valley peak (Down, down valley peak)</br>
					I keep my fee-fi-fo-fum (Fee-fi-fo-fum)</br>
					I keep my heart undone (My heart undone)</br></br>

					And I love myself</br>
					(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)</br>
					I love myself</br>
					(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)</br>
					I love myself</br>
					(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)</br>
					I love myself</br>
					(One day at the time, sun gone shine)</br></br>

					I went to war last night</br>
					With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic</br>
					I'm a do it 'til I get it right</br>
					I went to war last night</br>
					I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent</br>
					Duckin' every other blessin', l can never see the message</br>
					I can never take the lead, I can never bob and weave</br>
					For my nigga that be letting 'em annihilate me</br>
					And the sound is moving in a meteor speed</br>
					From a 100 to a billion lay my body in the street</br>
					Keep my money in the ceiling let my mama know I'm free</br>
					Give my story to the children and the lesson they can read</br>
					And the glory to the feeling of the only unseen</br>
					Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!"</br></br>

					I lost my head, I must've misread what the good book said</br>
					Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside</br>
					Give myself again 'til the well runs dry

					[Chorus]</br>
					It may not mean nothing to y'all</br>
					But understand nothing was done for me</br>
					So I don't plan on stopping at all</br>
					I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine</br>
					I'm shutting shit down in the mall</br>
					And telling every girl she the one for me</br>
					And I ain't even planning to call</br>
					I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mine</br></br>

					[Drake]</br>
					Last name ever</br>
					First name greatest</br>
					Like a sprained ankle boy I ain't nothing to play with</br>
					Started off local but thanks to all the haters</br>
					I know G4 pilots on a first name basis</br>
					In your city faded off the brown, Nino</br>
					She insists she got more class, we know</br>
					Swimming in the money, come and find me, Nemo</br>
					If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo</br>
					Drop the mix tape that shit sounded like an album</br>
					Who'da thought a country wide tour'd be the outcome</br>
					Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm</br>
					Everybody got a deal, I did it without one</br>
					Yeah, nigga I'm about my business</br>
					Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list</br>
					Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness</br>
					If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches</br></br>

					[Chorus]</br></br>

					[Kanye West]</br>
					Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the building</br>
					Ain't no question who about to kill 'em</br>
					I used to have hood dreams</br>
					Big fame, big chains</br>
					I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came</br>
					I went hard all fall like the ball teams</br>
					Just so I can make it rain all spring</br>
					Y'all seen my story, my glory</br>
					I had raped the game young</br>
					You can call it statutory</br>
					When a nigga blow up they gon' build statues for me</br>
					Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothing</br>
					Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin</br>
					You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband</br>
					You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't</br>
					Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't</br>
					Um, you're such a fucking loser</br>
					He didn't even go to class Bueller</br>
					Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back</br>
					Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack</br>
					Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac</br>
					All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act</br>
					They pull their cameras out and goddamn he snap</br>
					I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back</br></br>

					[Chorus]</br></br>

					[Lil Wayne]</br>
					OK, hello it's the Martian</br>
					Space jam Jordans</br>
					I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden</br>
					Fresher than the harvest</br>
					Step up to the target</br>
					If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans</br>
					And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops</br>
					Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top."</br>
					Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops</br>
					But what should I scream for? This is my theme park</br>
					My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark</br>
					Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk</br>
					Let the king talk check the price and pay attention</br>
					Lil Wayne that's what they gotta say or mention</br>
					I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer</br>
					I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover</br>
					Shhh, my foot's sleeping on the gas</br>
					No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh.</br></br>

					[Chorus]</br></br>

					[Eminem]</br>
					There they go, packing stadiums as Shady spits his flow</br>
					Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic, whoa</br>
					He can make them look like Bozos</br>
					He's wondering if he should spit this slow</br>
					Fuck no! Go for broke</br>
					this cup just runneth over, oh no</br>
					He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed</br>
					They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose</br>
					Back into the game and they know</br>
					Rap will never be the same as before</br>
					Bashing in the brains of these hoes</br>
					And establishing the name as he goes</br>
					The passion and the flame is ignited</br>
					You can't put it out once we light it</br>
					This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot</br>
					You dealing with a few true villains</br>
					Who stand inside of a booth truth spilling</br>
					And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths</br>
					Now rewind it!</br>
					Pay back motherfucker for the way that you got at me how's it taste?</br>
					When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place</br>
					I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face</br>
					You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place</br>
					So Drake</br></br>

					Give me that old school love right now</br>
					You know when I hold you, you won't be alone...</br></br>

					As long as I'm here</br>
					As long as you love me</br>
					Give me that old school love right now</br></br>

					Give me that late 80s early 90s old school</br>
					Feeling like my second album, so cool</br>
					Chiraq summer looking so cruel</br>
					Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules</br>
					Went to speak but was like never mind</br>
					Let my mind just sneak back to a better time</br>
					When I was his age and if he's ever mine</br>
					Thinking he would only think back to this and never find</br>
					Better times to think back to when it comes</br>
					And he's older in the presence of somebody young</br>
					Telling him the same things that he told me</br>
					And he reacts the same way as that OG</br>
					But it's old school, it's like '03</br>
					And this old man is my old me</br>
					Takes a long time to happen so fast</br>
					To realize that your future is somebody else's past</br>
					Wassup...</br></br>

					As long as I'm here</br>
					As long as you love me</br>
					Give me that old school love right now [x2]</br></br>

					Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good</br>
					Top down, can't be a classic if it's no wood</br>
					If you don't know what, then you new school</br>
					Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes</br>
					Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews</br>
					Melli Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools</br>
					Add a Moe Dee and a Double L</br>
					Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells</br>
					One microphone and a couple 12s</br>
					Six drum sounds and a couple bells</br>
					Is all you had to make a couple rails</br>
					And that's a trap, and if you want it (eeeeeeeh)</br>
					You have to make it like that</br>
					Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?</br>
					Takes a long time to happen so fast</br>
					And realize your future is somebody else's past</br>
					Wassup...</br></br>

					As long as I'm here</br>
					As long as you love me</br>
					Give me that old school love right now [x2]</br></br>

					Chiraq summer looking so cruel</br>
					How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?</br>
					I can't dig it at all because there's no tube</br>
					Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals</br>
					Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind</br>
					If it's better with time then think in line</br>
					That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis</br>
					If you're life like Christ live your midlife like it's... Christ-like</br>
					Nigga I ain't psychic</br>
					I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it</br>
					And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements</br>
					But you might need a hand to enhance your performance</br>
					Consider this a kilogram of encouragement</br>
					Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement</br>
					And when you get it through in a manner so cool</br>
					Remember to give a little nod to the old school</br>
					Wassup...</br></br>

					Give me that old school love right now</br>
					I'm leaving it all up to you darling, giving you everything you want</br>
					And give me that old school love right now</br>
					You know when I hold you, you won't be alone...</br></br>

					As long as I'm here</br>
					As long as you love me</br>
					Give me that old school love right now [x2]

					You said you'd never ever break... down</br>
					But here I am sweeping... pieces off of the ground</br>
					You said you'd never, ever play... to crowds</br>
					But I've seen you hoping to play songs to them now</br>
					I've spent all night long scared of tomorrow, broke my alarm</br>
					Everything is almost lost, pick it up slow, before it's gone...</br></br>

					[Hook]</br>
					We're fragile</br>
					(Wish I'd have known)</br>
					I never thought I'd be so fragile</br>
					(You're not alone)</br>
					If it didn't break before it's about to</br>
					(We've been here before)</br>
					I don't ever want to change</br>
					I'm fragile</br>
					I don't ever...</br></br>

					Some of the people appointed to give an opinion</br>
					Never do get it</br>
					I want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and... die</br>
					N9na be giving the remedy and why?</br>
					Critics are really the enemy and I</br>
					Can't stand the way they slam today's gifted</br>
					Effin' incredible, get fanned away with grands to pay</br>
					This jam will lay scripted</br>
					Deaf and impeccable</br>
					Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow</br>
					I'm the N9ne I'm a look very mean</br>
					When a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show</br>
					By the times it'll be better, leave it in the sto.</br>
					Cause they wrote nothin' but lies, quotes stuck in my eyes</br>
					Amateur writer dissin'</br>
					He's a beginner and hopes for your demise, folks some may despise</br>
					Never do try to listen</br>
					It's real - I'm mad</br>
					Clueless when you scribble on your pad</br>
					How you gonna criticize with a chisel on your nads sizzling your ad.</br>
					You don't really get why I'm so pissed? Understand this: (understand this)</br>
					I'm an artist, and I'm sensitive about my shit, yes I'm</br></br>

					[Hook]</br></br>

					Tell me that I'm famous</br>
					Tell me that my name is</br>
					Big as Venus Jupiter and then Uranus</br>
					Tell me that your anus got your head in it</br>
					I can smell the articles and know you're heinous</br>
					Tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me</br>
					Unconditional, I'm hoping I'm your favourite</br>
					Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks</br>
					That's the feelin' I get when you're concentratin'</br>
					On this pen, on this pad</br>
					Tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft</br>
					Tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track</br>
					Stop...</br>
					Puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines</br>
					Tellin' me platinum and gold all the time</br>
					Lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine</br>
					Drop...</br>
					This is more than you, and this is more than you</br>
					And your entire building slanderin' and abusin'</br>
					What I call the realest comin' from a student</br>
					Told myself to use a poem as an UZI</br>
					Empty magazine, I seen a magazine</br>
					You seen my trigger finger, then I started shootin'</br>
					That was nicotine, I'm bout to smoke 'em all</br>
					And journalists involved should've known my music</br></br>

					Yeah, uh</br>
					One time for the nigga in the back</br>
					One time for the home girl</br>
					In the front row, with her feet up</br></br>

					Me and Doza riding round and picking girls up</br>
					Just some young guys trying to win and pick the world up</br>
					Walk around the city with my city on my shoulder</br>
					When my cousin died I felt the city get colder</br>
					They was only in it for the money and the power</br>
					I was only in it for the bitties to yell louder</br>
					Now I'm only in it cause I do not know a coward</br>
					Hungry for it all, game looking like chowder</br>
					And all the kids wanna hear about a real guy</br>
					About a young prince try to get the real life</br>
					If you made it baby tell me what it feel like</br>
					Cause I dream about it, dream about it every night</br>
					One loss is another man's treasure</br>
					Sometimes it's too much pressure</br>
					To be this good, to be this real</br>
					To be me stupid, to be me</br></br>

					Been a while since we came together</br>
					And all these years just seem like forever</br>
					Not the same guy you knew in high school (I grew up)</br>
					Who knew we'd ever get older</br>
					They tried to change us</br>
					We had to hold our own</br>
					Won't let it break us, down, down</br>
					They tried to change us</br>
					We had to hold our own</br>
					Won't let it break us, down, down no</br></br>

					Was a broom, took a bit to be a vacuum</br>
					To be a leader of achievers in a dark room</br>
					Sweep it up or take it in and make an iTune</br>
					Or make a life you can't believe just like a cartoon</br>
					Oh I can't believe it took so long to be myself</br>
					Forget the wealth</br>
					Took the belt for bringing niggas hell</br>
					Anytime where evil people make the world spin</br>
					I took a vow made a promise to my girlfriend</br>
					Told her I would be the truest of the newest guys</br>
					Keep a missile for the issues like it's do or die</br>
					Or keep a pistol if I need to in my newest ride</br>
					To kill myself before they get me baby, suicide</br>
					Doors on the whip and a bottle full of Henney</br>
					That's more than you'll get if you plan on saving plenty</br>
					So we step on the gas and the tank is getting empty</br>
					And I look up at my best friend,</br>
					Homie we home</br></br>

					Oh girl, this boat is sinking</br>
					There's no sea left for me</br>
					And how the sky gets heavy</br>
					When you are underneath it!</br>
					Oh. I want to sail away from here.</br>
					And god. He came down down down down down down down down</br>
					And said (down down down down down down down down)</br>
					Nothing (down down down down down down down down)</br></br>

					He rolled up, asked him what he was sippin' on</br>
					He said lean, You want to hit it, dawg?</br>
					That's the same stuff</br>
					Weezy's sippin' huh?</br>
					And tons of other rappers that be spittin' hard</br>
					Yup yup five a bone</br>
					When he passed him that Styrofoam the Easter pink, heard it in a rhyme before</br>
					Finally got to see what all the hype was on</br>
					And then he took a sip, sittin' in the Lincoln thinkin' he was pimpin' as he listen to the system</br>
					Little did he know that it was just as addictive as bass</br>
					Not the kind of hit from the kick drum</br>
					Hot box, let the bass bump</br>
					Take it to the face, gulp</br>
					Months later the use went up</br>
					Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff</br>
					But Goddamn he loved that feelin'</br>
					Purple rain coated in the throat</br>
					Just so healin'</br>
					Medicine alleviate the sickness</br>
					Liquid affix and it comes with a cost</br>
					Wake up, cold sweat, scratchin', itchin'</br>
					Trying to escape the skin that barely fit him</br>
					Gone, get another bottle just to get a couple swallows</br>
					Headed towards the bottom couldn't get off it</br>
					Didn't even think he had a problem</br>
					Though he couldn't sleep without gettin' nauseous</br>
					Room spinnin', thinkin' he might've sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup</br>
					His eyelids closed shut</br>
					Sat back in the chair clutchin' that cup</br>
					Girlfriend came and a couple hours later said his name shook him but he never got up</br></br>

					He never got up, he never got up</br>
					We live on the cusp of death thinkin' that it won't be us</br>
					It won't be us, it won't be us, it won't be us</br>
					Nah, it won't be us</br>
					Oh girl, this boat is sinking</br>
					There's no sea left for me</br>
					And how the sky gets heavy</br>
					When you are underneath it!</br>
					Oh. I want to sail away from here.</br>
					And god. He came down down down down down down down down</br>
					And said (down down down down down down down down)</br>
					Nothing (down down down down down down down down)</br></br>

					He just wanted to act like them</br>
					He just wanted to rap like him</br>
					Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids</br>
					Blunt passed, ash in a tin, pack being pushed, harassed by the feds</br>
					The fact of it is most people that rap like this talkin' about some shit they haven't lived</br>
					Surprise, you know the drill</br>
					Trapped in a box, declined record sales</br>
					Follow the formula violence, drugs, and, sex sells</br>
					So we try to sound like someone else</br>
					This is not Californication</br>
					There's no way to glorify this pavement</br>
					Syrup, Percocet, and an eighth a day will leave you broke, depressed, and emotionally vacant</br>
					Despite how Lil Wayne lives</br>
					It's not conducive to being creative</br>
					And I know 'cause he's my favorite</br>
					And I know 'cause I was off that same mix</br>
					Rationalize the shit that I'd try after I listen to dedication</br>
					But he's an alien, I'd sip that shit, pass out or play Playstation</br>
					Months later I'm in the same place</br>
					No music made, feeling like a failure</br>
					And trust me it's not dope to be 25 and move back to your parent's basement</br>
					I've seen my people's dreams die</br>
					I've seen what they can be denied</br>
					And "weeds not a drug" - that's denial</br>
					Groundhog Day life repeat each time</br>
					I've seen Oxycontin take three lives</br>
					I grew up with them, we used to chief dimes</br>
					I've seen cocaine bring out the demons inside</br>
					Cheatin' and lyin'</br>
					Friendship cease, no peace in the mind</br>
					Stealin' and takin' anything to fix the pieces inside</br>
					Broken, hopeless, headed nowhere</br>
					Only motivation for what the dealer's supplying</br>
					That rush, that drug, that dope</br>
					Those pills, that crumb, that roach</br>
					Thinkin' I would never do that, not that drug</br>
					And growing up nobody ever does</br>
					Until you're stuck, lookin' in the mirror like I can't believe what I've become</br>
					Swore I was gonna be someone</br>
					And growing up everyone always does</br>
					We sell our dreams and our potential</br>
					To escape through that buzz</br>
					Just keep me up, keep me up</br>
					Hollywood here we come</br></br>

					Oh girl this boat is sinking</br>
					There's no sea left for me</br>
					And how the sky gets heavy</br>
					When you are underneath it</br>
					Oh, I want to sail away from here</br>
					And god. He came down down down down down down down</br>
					And said</br>
					Nothing
