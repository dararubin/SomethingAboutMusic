					Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?</br>
					Am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?</br></br>

					I ain't tryna do what everybody else doing</br>
					Just cause everybody doing what they all do</br>
					If one thing I know, I'll fall but I'll grow</br>
					I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home</br></br>

					So am I wrong</br>
					For thinking that we could be something for real?</br>
					Now am I wrong</br>
					For trying to reach the things that I can't see?</br></br>

					But that's just how I feel,</br>
					That's just how I feel</br>
					That's just how I feel</br>
					Trying to reach the things that I can't see</br></br>

					Am I tripping for having a vision?</br>
					My prediction: I'mma be on the top of the world</br></br>

					Walk your walk and don't look back, always do what you decide</br>
					Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel</br>
					Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let them compare you, no</br>
					Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how we feel</br></br>

					Am I wrong (am I wrong)</br>
					For thinking that we could be something for real?</br>
					(oh yeah yeah yeah oh)</br>
					Now am I wrong (am I wrong)</br>
					For trying to reach the things that I can't see?</br>
					(oh yeah yeah yeah yeah)</br></br>

					But that's just how I feel,</br>
					That's just how I feel</br>
					That's just how I feel</br>
					Trying to reach the things that I can't see</br></br>

					If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong</br>
					I don't wanna be right, right</br>
					If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong</br>
					I don't wanna be right [2x]</br></br>

					Am I wrong</br>
					For thinking that we could be something for real?</br>
					Now am I wrong</br>
					For trying to reach the things that I can't see?</br></br>

					But that's just how I feel,</br>
					That's just how I feel</br>
					That's just how I feel</br>
					Trying to reach the things that I can't see</br></br>

					So am I wrong (am I wrong)</br>
					For thinking that we could be something for real?</br>
					(oh yeah yeah yeah oh)</br>
					Now am I wrong (am I wrong)</br>
					For trying to reach the things that I can't see?</br>
					(oh yeah yeah yeah yeah)</br></br>

					But that's just how I feel,</br>
					That's just how I feel</br>
					That's just how I feel</br>

					I'm gonna love ya</br>
					Until you hate me</br>
					And I'm gonna show ya</br>
					What's really crazy</br>
					You should've known better</br>
					Than to mess with me, honey</br>
					I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya</br>
					Gonna love ya, gonna love ya</br>
					Like a black widow, baby</br></br>

					This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same</br>
					First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray</br>
					We went from nothing to something, liking to loving</br>
					It was us against the world and now we just fucking</br>
					It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you</br>
					Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you</br>
					I wanted all or nothing for us ain't no place in between</br>
					Might, might be me believing what you say that you never mean</br>
					Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long</br>
					If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song</br>
					You were different from my last but now you got it mirrored</br>
					And as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer</br>
					Now sing</br></br>

					You used to be thirsty for me</br>
					But now you wanna be set free</br>
					This is the web, web that you weave</br>
					So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)</br></br>

					I'm gonna love ya</br>
					Until you hate me (Right)</br>
					And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what show 'em what)</br>
					What's really crazy</br>
					You should've known better</br>
					Than to mess with me, honey (it's all over with now)</br>
					I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya</br>
					Gonna love ya, gonna love ya</br>
					Like a black widow, baby</br></br>

					Black, black widow, baby</br></br>

					I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts</br>
					Just to get you I'm doing whatever works</br>
					You've never met nobody</br>
					That'll do you how I do ya</br>
					That will bring you to your knees</br>
					Praise Jesus hallelujah</br>
					I'm-a make you beg for it, plead for it</br>
					Till you feel like you breathe for it</br>
					Till you do any and everything for it</br>
					I want you to fiend for it</br>
					Wake up and dream for it</br>
					Till it's got you gasping for air</br>
					And you lean for it</br>
					'Till they have a CAT scan and check on your mind</br>
					And it's nothing but me, on it (on it, on it, on it)</br>
					Now it's me-time believe that</br>
					If it's yours when you want it</br>
					I wouldn't promise I need that</br>
					Till I'm everywhere that you be at</br>
					I can't fall back go quick</br>
					Cause this here a fatal attraction so I take it all or I don't want shit</br></br>

					You used to be thirsty for me (Right)</br>
					But now you wanna be set free</br>
					This is the web, web that you weave</br>
					So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)</br></br>

					Until you hate me (Right)</br>
					And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what show 'em what)</br>
					What's really crazy</br>
					You should've known better</br>
					Than to mess with me, honey</br>
					I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya</br>
					Gonna love ya, gonna love ya</br>

					Nice to meet you, where you been?</br>
					I could show you incredible things</br>
					Magic, madness, heaven, sin</br>
					Saw you there and I thought</br>
					Oh my God, look at that face</br>
					You look like my next mistake</br>
					Love's a game, wanna play?</br></br>

					New money, suit and tie</br>
					I can read you like a magazine</br>
					Ain't it funny, rumors fly</br>
					And I know you heard about me</br>
					So hey, let's be friends</br>
					I'm dying to see how this one ends</br>
					Grab your passport and my hand</br>
					I can make the bad guys good for a weekend</br></br>

					So it's gonna be forever</br>
					Or it's gonna go down in flames</br>
					You can tell me when it's over</br>
					If the high was worth the pain</br>
					Got a long list of ex-lovers</br>
					They'll tell you I'm insane</br>
					'Cause you know I love the players</br>
					And you love the game</br></br>

					'Cause we're young and we're reckless</br>
					We'll take this way too far</br>
					It'll leave you breathless</br>
					Or with a nasty scar</br>
					Got a long list of ex-lovers</br>
					They'll tell you I'm insane</br>
					But I've got a blank space, baby</br>
					And I'll write your name</br></br>

					Cherry lips, crystal skies</br>
					I could show you incredible things</br>
					Stolen kisses, pretty lies</br>
					You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen</br>
					Find out what you want</br>
					Be that girl for a month</br>
					Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no</br></br>

					Screaming, crying, perfect storms</br>
					I can make all the tables turn</br>
					Rose garden filled with thorns</br>
					Keep you second guessing like</br>
					"Oh my God, who is she?"</br>
					I get drunk on jealousy</br>
					But you'll come back each time you leave</br>
					'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream</br></br>

					So it's gonna be forever</br>
					Or it's gonna go down in flames</br>
					You can tell me when it's over</br>
					If the high was worth the pain</br>
					Got a long list of ex-lovers</br>
					They'll tell you I'm insane</br>
					'Cause you know I love the players</br>
					And you love the game</br></br>

					'Cause we're young and we're reckless</br>
					We'll take this way too far</br>
					It'll leave you breathless</br>
					Or with a nasty scar</br>
					Got a long list of ex-lovers</br>
					They'll tell you I'm insane</br>
					But I've got a blank space, baby</br>
					And I'll write your name</br></br>

					Boys only want love if it's torture</br>
					Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya</br>
					Boys only want love if it's torture</br>
					Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya</br></br>

					So it's gonna be forever</br>
					Or it's gonna go down in flames</br>
					You can tell me when it's over</br>
