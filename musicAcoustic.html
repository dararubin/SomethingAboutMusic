				<h4>Lyrics </h4>
				<p><input type="button" value="Show" onclick="this.value = showElement('lyrics1')">No Faith in Brooklyn<div id="lyrics1" style="display: none";> 
We should take a walk someday</br>
Dream about what we could've been</br>
But I don't wanna leave this place</br>
No faith in Brooklyn</br>
If I move out one day</br>
It will make me a better man</br>
But I don't wanna leave this place</br>
No faith in Brooklyn</br></br>

I said I'm so gone, oh my God, where's the menu?</br>
Order me all your sushi for all them bitches at the venue</br>
Stop, drop, roll, continue</br>
Cause haters try to mingle, and I'm just tryin' to sing you a song</br>
Tell ya that I'm leavin' but I won't be long</br>
If it was up to me I'd see ya tomarr</br>
But talk's cheap so I'm payin' up</br>
New kicks be the only way I'm layin' up</br>
So maybe I won't make it as an athlete</br>
But that don't mean I'll let the competition pass me</br>
I money ball, Billy Beane and some skinny jeans</br>
And the whole damn team just some mini me's</br>
Cause they ain't seen another kid like this</br>
It's on your mind baby you should probably write this</br>
I told her I can dance good for a white kid</br>
So turn around, show me everything I might miss</br></br>

We should take a walk someday</br>
Dream about what we could've been</br>
But I don't wanna leave this place</br>
No faith in Brooklyn</br>
If I move out one day</br>
It will make me a better man</br>
But I don't wanna leave this place</br>
No faith in Brooklyn</br></br>

I said repetition-repe-repetition like a muscle man</br>
You just wanna tie me up, snap me like a rubber band</br>
It's 2012 so now they wanna ask me what's the plan</br>
I tell 'em never trust a man unless he Russell Brands</br>
Pass me on that Absinthe now watch me change my accent</br>
I got girls in the back on a mattress</br>
You got girls on the map like that's it</br>
They wanna know, am I Jay Sean or Raekwon</br>
Good sean, or Great Sean</br>
Stay long or Kreayshawn</br>
Now, either way, they try to cipher your dreams</br>
I tell 'em keep your eyes open, you won't like what you see</br>
They be here for a minute, now they gone in a week</br>
You try to Donte the peak, I'm tryna Andre the beat</br>
Lord, can you tell me where my faith is</br>
I graduated and I still ain't made the A-List</br>
Ain't a problem if you tell me how you feel girl</br>
I know the Road Rules but you need the Real World</br></br>

We should take a walk someday</br>
Dream about what we could've been</br>
But I don't wanna leave this place</br>
No faith in Brooklyn</br>
If I move out one day</br>
It will make me a better man</br>
But I don't wanna leave this place</br>
No faith in Brooklyn</br></br>

I've got no fatih, no faith, no faith in Brooklyn [x4]</br></br>

We should take a walk someday</br>
Dream about what we could've been</br>
But I don't wanna leave this place</br>
No faith in Brooklyn</br>
If I move out one day</br>
It will make me a better man</br>
But I don't wanna leave this place</br>
No faith in Brooklyn

And I know that there are miles in between where we both are. </br>
But in my memories and dreams just know, you're never very far. </br>
Don't be upset we'll both be home soon and we'll hold each other close.</br> 
We'll stay up late so I can tell you all the secrets no one knows. </br>
It's time to go to sleep now, Love. You're the one that I'll be dreaming of. </br></br>

And all these miles and states can't separate us both forever. </br>
And I'll keep praying for the day when we can simply be together. </br>
Until then I'm holding on for you and you alone tonight. </br>
Wishing that I could just be close and catch the tears you shouldn't cry. </br>
I'll catch the tears you should not cry. </br></br>

I hold this photograph of us that I have seen so many times. </br>
And I just can't believe that you would ever let me call you mine.</br> 
I don't deserve you and I'm pretty sure you know it in your heart. </br>
But if I ever feel alone I know just right where you are. </br></br>

And all these miles and states can't separate us both forever. </br>
And I'll keep praying for the day when we can simply be together. </br>
Until then I'm holding on for you and you alone tonight. </br>
Wishing that I could just be close and catch the tears you shouldn't cry. </br>
I'll catch the tears you should not cry. </br></br>

There is nothing that could keep me from covering this distance. </br>
Hand in hand we run, so na√Øve in finding out what this is. </br>
Beautiful could never have a single thing on you. </br>
Just like the angel that you are, I could never live without you. </br>
It's time to go to sleep now, Love. </br>
But you're the one that I'll be dreaming of. </br></br>

nd all these miles and states can't separate us both forever. </br>
And I'll keep praying for the day when we can simply be together. </br>
Until then I'm holding on for you and you alone tonight. </br>
Wishing that I could just be close and catch the tears you shouldn't cry. </br>
I'll catch the tears you should not cry. </br></br>

And all these miles and states can't separate us both forever.</br>
And I'll keep praying for the day when we can simply be together. </br>
Until then I'm holding on for you and you alone tonight. </br>
Wishing that I could just be close and catch the tears you shouldn't cry. </br>
I'll catch the tears you should not cry. </br>
I'll catch the tears you should not cry. </br>
I'll catch the tears you shouldn't cry. </br>
Please don't cry.

I wish I was a slave to an age-old trade</br>
Like ridin' around on railcars and workin' long days</br></br>

Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways</br>
Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways</br></br>

Call it one drink too many</br>
Call it pride of a man</br>
But it don't make no difference if you sit or you stand</br></br>

'Cause they both end in trouble and start with a grin </br>
Yeah they both end in trouble and start with a grin</br></br>

We do it over and over and over again</br>
We do it over and over and over again</br></br>

Oh-oh</br>

Oh-oh</br></br>

I know there's California, Oklahoma</br>
And all of the places I ain't ever been to but</br>
Down in the valley with</br>
Whiskey rivers</br>
These are the places you will find me hidin'</br>
These are the places I will always go</br>
These are the places I will always go</br></br>

I am on my way</br>
I am on my way</br>
I am on my way back to where I started</br></br>

Oh-oh</br>

Oh-oh</br></br>

Oh-oh</br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh</br>
Oh-oh</br></br>


One more for the stars and the eyes of the walls</br>
I saw your face, I heard you callin' out</br></br>

I saw your face in the crowd and you came out</br>
Just like the sun and the moon and the stars at night</br></br>

There was a sign on the door and it reads to me</br>
Just like the sun and the moon and the stars at night</br></br>

Oh-oh</br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh</br>
Oh-oh</br></br>

Oh-oh</br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh</br>

She'll lie and steal, and cheat, and beg you from her knees</br>
Make you think she means it this time</br>
She'll tear a hole in you, the one you can't repair</br>
But I still love her, I don't really care</br></br>

When we were young, oh, oh, we did enough</br>
When it got cold, ooh, ooh, we bundled up</br>
I can't be told, ah, ah, it can't be done</br></br>

It's better to feel pain, than nothing at all</br>
The opposite of love's indifference</br>
So pay attention now, I'm standing on your porch screaming out</br>
And I won't leave until you come downstairs</br></br>

So keep your head up, keep your love</br>
Keep your head up, my love [x2]</br>
Keep your head up, keep your love</br></br>

And I don't blame you dear for running like you did all these years</br>
I would do the same, you'd best believe</br>
And the highway signs say we're close but I don't read those things anymore</br>
I never trusted my own eyes</br></br>

When we were young oh, oh, we did enough</br>
When it got cold, ooh, ooh we bundled up</br>
I can't be told, ah, ah, it can't be done</br></br>

So keep your head up, keep your love</br>
Keep your head up, my love [x2]</br>
Keep your head up, keep your love</br>
Head up, love</br>
Head up, love</br>
Head up, love</br>
Head up, love</br>

Disappear from your home town</br>
Go and find the people that you know</br>
Show them all of your good parts</br>
Leave town when the bad ones start to show</br></br>

Go and wed a woman</br>
A pretty girl that you never met</br>
Make sure she knows you love her well</br>
But don't make any other promises</br></br>

The weight of lies will bring you down</br>
And follow you to every town 'cause</br>
Nothing happens here that doesn't happen there</br>
So, when you run make sure you run</br>
To something and not away from 'cause</br>
Lies don't need an aeroplane to chase you anywhere</br></br>

I once heard the worst thing a man can do is draw a hungry crowd</br>
Tell everyone his name, pride, and confidence</br>
But leaving out his doubts</br>
I'm not sure I bought those words</br>
When I was young I knew most everything</br>
These words have never meant as much to anyone</br>
As they now mean to me</br></br>

The weight of lies will bring you down</br>
And follow you to every town 'cause</br>
Nothing happens here that doesn't happen there</br>
So, when you run make sure you run</br>
To something and not away from 'cause</br>
Lies don't need an aeroplane to chase you down</br></br>

The weight of lies will bring you down</br>
And follow you to every town 'cause</br>
Nothing happens here that doesn't happen there</br>
So, when you run make sure you run</br>
To something and not away from 'cause</br>
Lies don't need an aeroplane to chase you anywhere</br></br>

The weight of lies will bring you down</br>
And follow you to every town 'cause</br>
Nothing happens here that doesn't happen there</br>
So when you run make sure you run</br>

Lies don't need an aeroplane to chase you down

Last night I dreamed I was brooklyn on my own</br>
Last night I dreamed I was brooklyn on my own</br>
Lord I couldn't see the shadows all in me,</br>
I dreamed I was in brooklyn on my own</br></br>

Now those demons had there face bright as gold</br>
Those demons had their faces bright as gold</br>
They came and shook my hand, fingers crossed behind their back</br>
Those demons had their faces bright as gold.</br></br>

So I'm sittin by my lonesome in the light</br>
I'm sittin by my lonesome in the light</br>
I don't know what I see, that light plays tricks on me</br>
I'm sittin by my lonesome in the light</br></br>

And I don't know whats ahead up comin next</br>
The wind shakes me feet, rattles my head</br>
There's no tellin home, just a sign up all alone</br>
Sayin oh, oh elizabeth</br></br>

And that season came in quiet with the rain</br>
And loving you was just like raising cain</br>
It was strong and bound for glory, and cursed with a thousand stories</br>
Oh that season came in quiet with the rain</br></br>

So I'm pickin up the pieces where I went wrong,</br>
Oh I'm pickin up the pieces where I went wrong,</br>
And there's somethin so familiar, like an old bedtime song</br>
I'm pickin up the pieces where I went wrong‚Ä¶</div></p>

Feeling my way through the darkness</br>
Guided by a beating heart</br>
I can't tell where the journey will end</br>
But I know where to start</br></br>

They tell me I'm too young to understand</br>
They say I'm caught up in a dream</br>
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes</br>
Well that's fine by me</br></br>

So wake me up when it's all over</br>
When I'm wiser and I'm older</br>
All this time I was finding myself</br>
And I didn't know I was lost [x2]</br></br>

I tried carrying the weight of the world</br>
But I only have two hands</br>
Hope I get the chance to travel the world</br>
But I don't have any plans</br></br>

Wish that I could stay forever this young</br>
Not afraid to close my eyes</br>
Life's a game made for everyone</br>
And love is the prize</br></br>

So wake me up when it's all over</br>
When I'm wiser and I'm older</br>

What would I do without your smart mouth?</br>
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out</br>
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down</br>
What's going on in that beautiful mind</br>
I'm on your magical mystery ride</br>
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright</br></br>

My head's under water</br>
But I'm breathing fine</br>
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind</br></br>

'Cause all of me</br>
Loves all of you</br>
Love your curves and all your edges</br>
All your perfect imperfections</br>
Give your all to me</br>
I'll give my all to you</br>
You're my end and my beginning</br>
Even when I lose I'm winning</br>
'Cause I give you all of me</br>
And you give me all of you, ohoh</br></br>

How many times do I have to tell you</br>
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too</br>
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood</br>
You're my downfall, you're my muse</br>
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues</br>
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you</br></br>

'Cause I give you all of me</br>
And you give me all of you, ohoh</br></br>

Give me all of you</br>
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts</br>
Risking it all, though it's hard</br></br>

'Cause all of me</br>
Loves all of you</br>
Love your curves and all your edges</br>
All your perfect imperfections</br>
Give your all to me</br>
